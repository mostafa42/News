                    technical skill, and are intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional
                    power.
                    The oldest documented forms of art are visual arts, which include images or objects
                    in fields like painting, sculpture, printmaking , photography, and other visual
                    media . Architecture is often included as one of the visual arts; however, like the
                    decorative arts, it involves the creation of objects where the practical
                    considerations of use are essential, in a way that they usually are not in another
                    visual art, like a painting.' ,

    'politicsWord' => 'Politics' ,
    'aboutPolitics' => 'Politics is a multifaceted word. It has a set of fairly specific meanings that are
                        descriptive and nonjudgmental (such as “the art or science of government” and
                        "political principles"), but it can and often does carry a negative meaning closely
                        related to these (“political activities characterized by artful and often dishonest
                        practices”). English is a flexible language, and it is not uncommon for a word to
                        have multiple related meanings that run the connotative gamut from good to bad. Some
                        of these have been around for a surprisingly long time. The negative sense of
                        politics, as seen in the phrase play politics, for example, has been in use since at
                        least 1853, when abolitionist Wendell Phillips declared: “We do not play politics;
                        anti-slavery is no half-jest with us.”' ,
